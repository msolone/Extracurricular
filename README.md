### Elevator Pitch

    There are 2 great loves in my life... family and coaching athletics, unfortunately the time commitment for both was too much to balance and I had to give up coaching to prioritize my family. So when I became a software developer I decided I would create products that would alleviate the time commitment placed on coaches by building products that would take some of the menial task that would normally take hours and reduce them to minutes or seconds, there for giving the coaches more time for their families. Thus the idea of Extracurricular was born, starting with an easy to use attendance app that takes the pen and paper strategy of most coaches and reduces it to super easy app!
